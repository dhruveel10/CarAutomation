# CarAutomation
Car Assistant is an IoT based system that helps the driver with the judgment of the vehicles moving in the front and back of his vehicle. It also provides the feature of automatic air conditioning control as per the temperature present inside the car. The next assistance is it provides with the headlight automation where the Car headlights gets automatically on/off according to the presence of sunlight in the surrounding to help the driver with proper visibility of the road. As most of the upcoming vehicle will be on electric energy it is important to save the energy for longer rides and this system will hence forth save a lot of electric energy that will increase the cars mileage as well. An Android app will help to display the user all the fetched data from the surrounding and a user-friendly interface will help the driver for any manual controls of the system. This system will make a big shot in the automobile industry for the coming years and we would be able to see such feature in the future cars.

Arduino IDE
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment - or Arduino Software (IDE) - contains a text editor for writing code, a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a series of menus. It connects to the Arduino and Genuino hardware to upload programs and communicate with them. The Arduino IDE employs the program avrdude to convert the executable code into a text file in hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board's firmware.

Proteus
The Proteus Design Suite is a proprietary software tool suite used primarily for electronic design automation. The software is used mainly by electronic design engineers and technicians to create schematics and electronic prints for manufacturing printed circuit boards.

Ardutooth App(Available on Play Store)
The easiest way to visualize Arduino Sensor-Data directly on your Android-Device in REALTIME! The App is able to display the values of up to 10 Sensors simultaneously (in Receiver-Mode).With the new Terminal-Mode you even can send data to your Arduino. The responds will also be shown in the App.
